NorthStar Retail — LLM Evaluation Harness (Track B/C)
CS 401R Lab 3 Starter Kit

Evaluation harness for the Offer Generation (RAG) and Customer Service Agent systems.

Track B (Offer Generation RAG):
    Evaluates using RAGAS metrics: faithfulness, answer_relevance, context_recall

Track C (Customer Service Agent):
    Evaluates using scenario-based testing: pass/fail per test case + trace analysis

Usage:
    # Track B — RAG evaluation
    python evaluation/evaluation_harness.py --track B \
        --rag-endpoint https://... \
        --test-cases tests/offer_test_cases.json

    # Track C — Agent evaluation
    python evaluation/evaluation_harness.py --track C \
        --agent-id <bedrock-agent-id> \
        --agent-alias-id <alias-id>

Requirements:
    pip install ragas datasets "langchain-community<0.4" langchain-aws boto3 pandas

    The langchain-community pin is REQUIRED, not belt-and-braces. That package
    is being sunset and has dropped `chat_models.vertexai`, which ragas imports
    at module load. Without the pin, `pip install ragas` succeeds and then:

        ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
        'langchain_community.chat_models.vertexai'

    ragas declares langchain-community with no upper bound, so pip resolves to
    the sunset version. Verified 2026-08-08: ragas 0.4.3 + langchain-community
    0.3.31 imports cleanly; 0.4.2 does not.

class LocalAgentEvaluator(AgentEvaluator):
    """Evaluate a ReAct agent you built yourself, over bedrock-runtime.

    USE THIS ONE. Managed Amazon Bedrock Agents is closed to new AWS accounts:

        AccessDeniedException: Bedrock Agents is in Maintenance Mode. New agent
        creation is not available for accounts without prior service usage.

    So you cannot obtain the --agent-id / --agent-alias-id that AgentEvaluator
    above needs, and neither can anyone else on a new account. Verified against
    Bedrock 2026-08-07. That class is retained only for students on older
    accounts that still have access.

    You supply one function. It takes the customer's message and returns the
    agent's reply plus the tool names your agent called, in order:

        def my_agent(message: str, session_id: str) -> tuple[str, list[str]]:
            ...
            return reply_text, ["lookup_order", "query_policy"]

    If your agent uses the Converse API, the tool names are already sitting in
    the conversation history -- Converse records each call as a `toolUse` block:

        reply = agent.chat(message)
        tools = [b["toolUse"]["name"]
                 for msg in agent.conversation_history
                 for b in (msg.get("content") or [])
                 if isinstance(b, dict) and "toolUse" in b]
        return reply, tools

    Scoring is identical either way -- the required/forbidden tool-call and
    escalation checks in evaluate_scenario() are inherited unchanged, so your
    grade does not depend on which path you took.
